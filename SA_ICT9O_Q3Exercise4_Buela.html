	<p class="text-light"> Hi, I'm Jesaiah Buela, I am a Filipina and I was born in August 4, 2008 and yes! I am now 14 years old. This photo above is a photo of my family's Christmas Vacation in Japan. Just so you have an idea, Japan is a country in Asia, and yes it has the flag with the red circle in the middle. It's filled with anime stuff and hi-tech machines. I was around Grade 3 this time, so maybe 8 years old? I may be very young at this time, but this was the greatest I've experienced outside of the Philippines. I've seen many things in this country and tasted various Japanese traditional dishes, it was amazing! It wasn't snowing there at that time, but that's alright, it was still really freezy. The most oustanding spot for me was the Tokyo Disneyland. Despite it being cold, I've managed to go to various rides such as the Roger Rabbit Cart ride and some other rides I couldn't remember much. That's because my favorite highlight was the night electric parade, but we'll jump into that later. There was one sad part in my experience though. It was the time when we were lining up for this intense rollercoaster in Disneyland itself, but it was raining when we've finally arrived at our turn for the ride. It was dissapointing, my mother told us we could get sick from the cold, especially that the rollercoaster was an open area ride. But hopefully at this time of year, we could get back there and ride that rollercoaster. Besides the rides in Tokyo Disneyland, let me talk about the food in the theme park itself. There were Burgers and nuggets shaped like a Mickey mouse figures, paired with fries. I remember these meals being quite costly, but it was still worth it. After eating, we've decided to take a watch on the Day Parade. It was beautiful, I've seen Disney princesses and old cartoon parade carts line up the aisle. It took like an hour before it ended, the day was very tiring until night came. It's time for the Electric Parade! It was really dark and Disney music played, just like as if I was in a fairytale. It felt like every little child's dream to have a sight of the electric glowing lights of the parade carts. I was very greatful to have the opportunity to be in Japan with my family. After the parade, we decided to watch the play entitled "One Man's Dream", this was also included in the Disneyland tour pack. It was a musical played filled with performers in colorful glittery costumes. After all, we arrived at my Aunt's home located near Tokyo. It was very tiring but I had so many fun as a child. If I was asked at this age if I would want to go there, I'd agree because I had so many memories in that country.</p>
